# Scheme
Scheme is a programming language that belongs to the Lisp family of programming languages. It is a dialect of Lisp that is known for its simplicity and elegance, with a minimalist syntax and powerful features. Scheme was designed by Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman in the 1970s and has since become one of the most popular and widely used Lisp dialects.

Some key features of Scheme include:

Minimal syntax: Scheme has a simple and minimalistic syntax that consists of a small number of primitive forms, such as lists and symbols, which can be combined to create complex expressions. This makes it easy to learn and understand.

Functional programming: Scheme is a fully functional programming language, which means that functions are first-class objects and can be passed as arguments, returned as values, and stored in variables. This makes it a powerful language for writing functional programs and implementing higher-order functions.

Dynamic typing: Scheme is dynamically typed, which means that the data types of variables are determined at runtime. This provides flexibility in programming, allowing for dynamic changes in data types and easy manipulation of data structures.

Lexical scoping: Scheme uses lexical scoping, which means that the value of a variable is determined by its closest enclosing scope. This allows for fine-grained control over variable bindings and makes it easier to reason about the behavior of a program.

Macro system: Scheme has a powerful macro system that allows programmers to define their own language constructs and extend the language itself. This provides a high level of flexibility and expressiveness in writing code.

Scheme standard libraries: Scheme comes with a rich set of standard libraries that provide various functionalities, such as arithmetic operations, string manipulation, input/output, and more. These libraries make it easy to write practical and efficient programs in Scheme.

Scheme is used in a wide range of applications, including academic research, artificial intelligence, numerical computing, and embedded systems. It is known for its elegance and expressiveness, making it a popular choice among Lisp enthusiasts and functional programming enthusiasts alike.

In Scheme, a programming language, the file extension commonly used for Scheme source code files is ".scm". For example, a Scheme program file may have a filename like "my_program.scm". However, it's worth noting that Scheme implementations may also use other file extensions, such as ".ss" or ".sld". The file extension is typically used to indicate the type of content in the file and to associate it with the appropriate programming language or interpreter. It's important to check the documentation or conventions of the specific Scheme implementation or development environment you are using to determine the preferred file extension for Scheme files in your particular context.
